# Assignment 2 Description

## Project Overview
This project is the second assignment for the COMP8880 course, covering topics such as probability distributions, graph analysis, and matrix operations. The main tasks are solved and visualized in a Jupyter Notebook, with Python utility functions supporting data processing and graph structure analysis.

## Main File Descriptions
- `Workbook.ipynb`: The main notebook containing detailed solutions, derivations, code implementations, and visualizations for all problems.
  - **Problem 1: Heavy-Tailed Distributions and Probability Analysis**
    - Includes heavy/light tail determination for Weibull distributions, conditional probability derivations, hazard rate analysis, empirical distribution and parameter fitting (e.g., Pareto and LogNormal), and comparison of distribution fits using K-S tests.
  - **Problem 2: Graph Spectrum Analysis and Clustering**
    - Covers construction of k-nearest neighbor and fully connected graphs from data points, computation of graph Laplacian matrices and their eigenvalues/eigenvectors, spectral clustering analysis, community and bipartite structure detection and visualization, and k-partite structure recovery.
    - Node grouping and structure visualization are achieved using spectral methods and clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans).
  - **Problem 3: Matrix and Point Coordinate Recovery**
    - Given affinity matrices, recovers original data point coordinates using MDS (multidimensional scaling), eigendecomposition, etc.
    - For partially observed affinity matrices, designs loss functions and gradients, and uses optimization algorithms (e.g., L-BFGS-B) for numerical recovery of point coordinates.
  - Each problem includes detailed mathematical derivations, code implementations, visualizations, and experimental result analysis, making it suitable for in-depth understanding of probabilistic modeling and graph spectrum analysis methods.
- `Utils.py`: Contains common utility functions, including:
  - Empirical CCDF calculation for probability distributions
  - Eigenvalue and eigenvector plotting
  - Reading graph structures from node/edge files
  - Adjacency matrix visualization
  - Reading graph structures with node colors and generating color adjacency matrices
- `Data/`: Contains raw data files required for each problem, organized in subfolders by problem.
- `Figures/`: Used to save images generated in the notebook.

## Usage Instructions
1. It is recommended to open `Workbook.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook or Colab and run the cells in order.
2. If running locally, please ensure the following dependencies are installed:
   - numpy
   - networkx
   - matplotlib
   - scipy
3. Data files do not need to be modified and can be read directly as referenced in the notebook.
4. If running in Colab, please follow the instructions at the beginning of the notebook to mount Google Drive and switch to the assignment directory.
